# Airport-Management-System
An airport management system is a software solution used to manage and coordinate the various functions and operations of an airport. These systems typically include modules for managing flight schedules, gate assignments, baggage handling, and passenger check-in and boarding. Some systems also include modules for managing ground services such as fueling, de-icing, and maintenance. The system can also include a component for managing the airport's resources such as personnel, equipment, and facilities. The goal of an airport management system is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of airport operations, while also providing valuable data and insights for airport management and decision-making.
